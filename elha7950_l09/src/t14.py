Lab 9, Task 14

Description: 
    Finds the distance between the s1 and s2. The distance between two
    strings of the same length is the number of positions in the strings
    at which their characters are different. If two strings are not the
    same length, the distance is unknown (-1). If the distance is zero,
    then two strings are equal.
